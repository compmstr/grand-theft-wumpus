# grand-theft-wumpus

Grand Theft wumpus inspired game from Land Of Lisp

After a failed heist, your partner in crime, the wumpus has left you in congestion city,
but not after you tagged him with a shot from your handgun.
You now have to find him in the city full of cop roadblocks and a rival gang
of glowworms.

When you are within 2 blocks of the wumpus, you will see blood
		 You only have one shot to shoot him before he shoots you
When you are within 1 block of a glowworm team (there are 3), you will see blinking lights
		 Glow worms will kidnap you, beat you up, rob you, and drop you in some random part of town
When you are next to a roadblock, you will hear sirens
		 game over if the cops find you
